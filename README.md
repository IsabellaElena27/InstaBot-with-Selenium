# InstaBot-with-Selenium

This is my first interaction with Selenium, so it was a challenge for me to create an Instagram Bot that sends messages automatically. 
First of all, this program finds the elements responsible to login (username and password) and sends my keys (which are saved in another .py file for security, I've imported it at the beginning of the script). 
After logging in, the notifications are skipped. and the program finds all the elements that will take us to the point of sending the message. In that moment, we are searching for a friend (from our list of friends) to whom we want to send a message. The message is inputted automatically and it will be sent in less than 2 seconds.
