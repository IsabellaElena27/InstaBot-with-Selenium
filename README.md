# InstaBot-with-Selenium

This is my first interaction with Selenium, so creating an Instagram Bot that sends messages automatically posed a challenge for me. Firstly, the program locates the elements responsible for login (username and password) and inputs my keys (which are stored in another .py file for security; I've imported it at the beginning of the script). Once logged in, the program skips the notifications and proceeds to find all the elements that will guide us to the message-sending point.

At that moment, we search for a friend from our list of friends to whom we intend to send a message. The message is automatically inputted and will be sent in less than 2 seconds.
